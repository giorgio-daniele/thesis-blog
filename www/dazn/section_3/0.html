        <p>
            The analysis of the results obtained from the supervised experiments highlights that the number of requests
            for audio and video resources remains fairly constant, both under conditions of limited bandwidth and when
            the event is distributed through TCP or UDP protocols. This behavior is attributable to the fact that, from
            an application perspective, audio and video streams are segmented into regular portions of predefined
            duration (about 2 seconds for platforms like DAZN). The temporal segmentation is independent of the quality
            of the video representations, which is why the number of segments that make up an event remains unchanged
            even as the quality of the transmitted content varies.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, it is observed that the quality of the video significantly increases with the increase in available
            bandwidth. When the bandwidth transitions from limited conditions (identified by a dark red color) to more
            favorable conditions (indicated by a light green color), the quality of the video increases substantially,
            measured in Kilobits per second (Kbps). This behavior is expected and consistent with the characteristics of
            the DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) protocol.
        </p>
        <p>
            In contrast, the quality of the audio shows no significant variations in relation to the bandwidth. This
            behavior can be explained by the fact that audio, compared to video, requires less data to maintain an
            acceptable quality level for the user. Even under conditions of limited bandwidth, the quality of the audio
            remains stable and satisfactory, without the need for frequent or drastic adjustments, as occurs for video
            streams. This confirms that the perceived quality of audio tends to be less sensitive to network changes
            compared to video, as users are often willing to accept lower quality audio without significantly affecting
            the overall experience.
        </p>

        <h3>Volumetric Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            From an application perspective, the client is responsible for generating HTTP messages in which it requests
            the download of a video or audio segment or the next manifest (HTTP message with a GET method, with no
            body). The server, in turn, is required to respond with a message containing the requested data (HTTP
            response message with a variable-size body). If the quality of the video is very high, the spatial density
            of the pixels is greater (240p, 360p, 480p, etc.), and therefore the size of each frame increases
            accordingly. It is expected that when the quality of the video is high, the volume of data sent from the
            server in the TCP or UDP stream reaching the client will reflect the size of the requested frames. In the
            following graphs, we have represented the evolution over time of the magnitude describing the number of
            bytes transported by the protocol in both directions. Subsequently, we used the CDF to represent the same
            magnitude in the probability space.
        </p>
        <p>
            As bandwidth changes, the identifier of the requested DASH resource representation changes for the client,
            but the physical size of the message does not change. This means that, regardless of the configured
            bandwidth, the TCP and UDP stream from the client to the server will always carry the same number of bytes.
            If this aspect is quite clear in TCP and widely verifiable from the following graphs, the same cannot be
            said for UDP. In UDP, it is indeed not possible to clearly distinguish which datagrams carry the HTTP
            messages, as the acknowledgment bytes of the QUIC protocol are also encapsulated in UDP. Therefore, while in
            TCP the represented size reflects 1:1 the size of the HTTP messages (net of the overhead from the TLS
            protocol), in UDP, the acknowledgment variable is also present.

            Furthermore, as long as the MTU (Maximum Transfer Unit) on the path does not change, the allocatable space
            in each segment or datagram is constant. The collateral effect of reproducing high-quality video is not only
            that it requires larger volumes to download but also increases the overhead from the protocol through a
            greater number of headers. This fact results in an increase in acknowledgment packets, both in TCP and in
            UDP, and explains the absence of a complete overlap of the curves describing the volumes emitted by the
            client under different bandwidth conditions, as it is not possible to separate the two types of datagrams in
            UDP.

        <h3>Temporal Analysis</h3>
        <p>
            From the graph showing the evolution of the average duration of bins, it is discovered that the playback
            process of the DAZN event always maximizes the quality of the playable video. For this reason, the
            percentage of free bandwidth compared to that occupied is always very small in all cases where there is no
            <em>surplus</em> of bandwidth. This is evident because the average duration of the bins overlaps across all
            bandwidths except for the supervised experiments in which no limitation is foreseen.
        </p>
        <p>
            In all cases where the ratio between free bandwidth and occupied bandwidth is very low, the data exchange
            between client and server is not impulsive: the download time for all bandwidths is constant because the
            download speed increases proportionally to the volume to be downloaded.
