    <p>
        This page is intended to display the names of DAZN servers, providing an overview of all services involved. It
        includes primary services, often referred to as <em>linears</em>, which are responsible for the distribution of video
        content. Additionally, secondary services are highlighted, which are involved in authentication, streaming
        support, and the loading of images and assets within the application. Finally, the page also covers tertiary
        services, which focus on telemetry, ensuring that performance and usage data are collected for analysis and
        improvement. On the left, there is the profile at TCP layer, while on the right there is the UDP layer profile.
