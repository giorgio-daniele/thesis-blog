    <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">TCP Flows</h4>
    <p> TCP flow reconstruction is available in both <code>complete</code> and <code>periodic</code> formats. In the
        first case, each flow is graphically represented through a time segment within the interval
        <code>[ts; te]</code>. Each flow begins at the moment when Tstat intercepts the TCP segment with
        <code>SYN = 1</code> and ends at the moment when Tstat intercepts the segment with <code>FIN = 1</code> or
        <code>RST = 1</code>. Each flow includes both volumetric metrics (the amount of bytes and packets sent from the
        client to the server and vice versa) and temporal metrics (average RTT). In the second case, each flow consists
        of a sequence of disjoint time intervals; each interval represents a portion of the communication between the
        client and the server, while the gaps represent silences that occurred between the two machines. Each interval
        contains the same metrics found in the corresponding <code>complete</code> document, relevant to the time window
        under consideration. </p>
