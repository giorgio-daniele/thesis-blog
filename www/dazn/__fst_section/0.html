    <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Reconstructed Flows</h2>
    <p>
        This page is designed to display all TCP and UDP flows that occurred during supervised experiments. For each
        tested
        bandwidth, multiple tests are available for selection. Once a test is selected, users can appreciate the flows
        that
        have occurred based on the CNAME, both at the TCP and UDP layers. Additionally, the page provides a
        reconstruction
        of the HTTP video streaming session, detailing the sequence of video and audio requests, as well as the index,
        particularly for DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP), which includes the Media Presentation Description
        (MPD).
