    <p> Starting from a trace in <code>.har</code> format, all transactions that occurred during the viewing of a DAZN
        event are reconstructed. In particular, the transactions that took place within the TCP and/or UDP flows
        associated with multimedia are reconstructed, namely the flows in which the client requests audio and video
        resources, as well as the Media Presentation Description (MPD). </p>
