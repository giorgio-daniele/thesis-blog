    <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">UDP Flows</h4>
    <p> UDP flow reconstruction is available in both <code>complete</code> and <code>periodic</code> formats. In the
        first case, each flow is graphically represented through a time segment within the interval
        <code>[ts; te]</code>. Since there is no concept of connection in UDP, the two flows (from the client to the
        server and from the server to the client) are independent. The choice made in this research focuses exclusively
        on the flow from the server to the client. Therefore, each UDP flow begins at the moment when Tstat intercepts a
        UDP datagram intended for a previously unknown client socket and ends after an extended period of inactivity,
        during which the server no longer transmits any data. In the second case, each flow is represented, as in the
        <code>TCP</code> counterpart, by an ordered sequence of disjoint time intervals, each representing a dialogue
        window between the server and the client. </p>
