    <h2 style="font-weight: bold;">Supervised Experiments</h2>
    <p>
        The <strong>supervised experiment</strong> is defined as the <em>systematic</em>,
        <em>repeatable</em>, and <em>computerized</em> visualization of one or more events streamed in real-time on
        the DAZN platform. This experiment serves as a fundamental analytical tool for the detailed reconstruction
        of the metrics that characterize each viewing session; in other words, it is an effective means of
        monitoring the network traffic generated during the viewing period and evaluating the quality of the event
        streamed on the user's device.
    </p>

        To meet the above requirements, a tool named <strong>Streambot</strong> has been developed. This is a
        command-line application that manages the lifecycle of a web browser and a network analyzer, recording
        network interactions in a HAR (HTTP Archive) file. The primary objective of Streambot is to automate
        browsing operations within the web application, simulating the behavior of a real user. In particular,
        Streambot is designed to start and stop the playback of a DAZN event, generating as output three types of
        documents: a <code>.pcap</code> file that contains the recording of all the network packets intercepted
        during the experiment, a <code>.har</code> file that collects the archive of HTTP requests and responses,
        and a <code>.csv</code> file that documents the timeline of the automated actions performed.

        This page is designed to display all TCP and UDP flows that occurred during supervised experiments. For each
        tested
        bandwidth, multiple tests are available for selection. Once a test is selected, users can appreciate the flows
        that
        have occurred based on the CNAME, both at the TCP and UDP layers. Additionally, the page provides a
        reconstruction
        of the HTTP video streaming session, detailing the sequence of video and audio requests, as well as the index,
        particularly for DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP), which includes the Media Presentation Description
        (MPD).
